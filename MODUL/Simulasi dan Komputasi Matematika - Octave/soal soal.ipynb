    "In some situations, the carrying capacity itself is dynamic. For example, the performance of airplanes had one carrying capacity with piston engines and a higher limit with the advent of jet engines. Many think that human population growth over a limited period of time follows such a pattern as technological changes enable more people to live on the available resources. In such cases, we might be able to model the carrying capacity itself as a logistic. Suppose $M_1$ is the first carrying capacity, and $M_1 + M_2$ is the second. The differential equation for the carrying capacity $M(t)$ as a function of time $t$ would be as follows:\n",

However, beginning about 1800 with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the carrying capacity appears to have increased to about 50 million people. The change in the concavity from concave up to concave down for this new logistic appears to occur in about 1850 (Meyer and Ausube‘ 1999).\n",

    "2. Develop a two-compartment model for aspirin, where someone with a headache takes three aspirin tablets and 2 h later takes two more aspirin tablets.\n",
    "3. In attempt to raise the concentration of a drug in the system to the minimum effective concentration quickly, sometimes doctors give a patient a loading dose, which is an initial dosage that is much higher than the maintenance dosage. A loading dose for Dilantin is three doses 400 mg, 300 mg, and 300 mg 2h apart. Twenty-four hours after the loading dose, normal dosage of 100 mg every 8 h begins. Develop a model for this dosage regime.\n",
    "4. Develop a two-compartment model for Dilantin, where the rate of change of absorption from the stomach to the blood serum is proportional to the amount of drug in the stomach.\n",
    "5. Develop a two-compartment model for Dilantin, where the rate of change of absorption from the stomach to the blood serum is proportional to the volume of the stomach and to the difference of the drug concentrations in the stomach and serum. Assume the volume of the stomach is 500 mL.\n",
    "6. Develop a two-compartment model for a pediatric dosage of Dilantin that includes the mass of the patient. The initial dose is 5 mg/kg per day in two or three equally divided doses. The maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg per day.\n",
    "7. Develop a model for vancomycin HCI, which is a treatment for serious infections by susceptible strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in penicillin-allergic patients. The drug is administered by IV infusion. The intravenous dose is usually 2 g divided either as 500 mg every 6 h or 1 g every 12 h, and the rate is no more than 10 mg/min or over a period of at least 50 min, whichever is longer. When kidney function is normal, multiple intravenous dosing of 1 g results in mean plasma concentrations of about 63 μg/mL immediately after infusion, 23 μg/mL in 2 h, and 8 μg/mL 11 h after infusion. In such patients, the mean elimination half-life from plasma is 4 to 6 h. The mean plasma clearance is approximately 0.058 L/kg/h (liter of drug per kilogram of patient mass each hour), while the mean renal clearance is about 0.048 L/kg/h (Hospira 2010). Thus, include the mass of the patient in the model.\n",

    "9. Develop a model for Vancocin HCI in which the patient initially has normal kidney function (see Project 7). However, at the start of the third day, one of the patientms kidneys stops functioning; and the elimination rate becomes half its previous value. Consider using a step function.\n",
